Questions:

Why is your solution better than currently existing solutions?
- research on similar approaches
- benchmarks

Why did you use this particular approach of ML/DL?
- compare to other approaches (my model A captures info a, b, c better than model X or Y .. etc)
- limitations in other approaches tackled in your solution

VALIDITY (this is where mine got a bit case i think)
- The solution you're addressing, is it really necessary?
- Domain specific validity, is it applicable.
- How can a person use it? And how it be different?

Code
- Layers of the model, why did you settle with these layers or this model?
- Does it capture necessary meaning/context required for the solution you want to give.

Domain Specific
- Depending on your domain, if you have told to achieve a particular feature. Is it a valid feature required? or extra.

- Here prepare for some domain stuff. Problem domain -> is it solved?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prep for Viva:
NLP - code approach
preprocessing

embedding - 
represent categorical data as vectors
which helps capture semantics


tokenization
- large text is broken down into sequences
- break down into tokens 

- the model expects standard data in same input shape and length
- it helps standardize the input

one hot encoding
- to represent categorical variables into a binary matrix
- models predict numbers not meaning.

model structure each layer
